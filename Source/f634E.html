	<h2>Song of Advice for Giving Up Meat Eating</h2>
<p><em>by Nyala Pema DÃ¼ndul</em></p>
<p>When I think of the suffering that meat eating brings,<br/>
I cannot bear the pain and anguish I feel within my heart. </p>
<p><em>Oá¹ maá¹i padme hÅ«á¹ hrÄ«á¸¥</em>! </p>
<p>From a state of emptiness and compassion, you guide beings âÂ <br/>
Noble AvalokiteÅvara, to you I pay homage. </p>
<p>Without having trained in love and compassion myself,<br/>
I ate the flesh of my mothers while lecturing others about cause and effect.<br/>
Without realizing the absolute, I wandered along the path of empty words.<br/>
I, the parrot-like beggar of White Rock,<br/>
Was practicing austerities and âextracting the essenceâ,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
When, one day, while meditating on Lord AvalokiteÅvara,<br/>
According to the union of stages from <em>Self-Liberation Equal to Space</em>,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
My own body and everything around me suddenly disappeared<br/>
And transformed into a luminous body like that of the Great Compassionate One,<br/>
Seemingly floating in space. </p>
<p>As I looked around while experiencing luminous awareness,<br/>
I saw the inconceivable miseries of the lower realms.<br/>
And, in particular, the vast sufferings of the Reviving Hell.<br/>
One of its quarters, I saw, was completely filled<br/>
With men and women, naked and helpless, before each of whom<br/>
Stood throngs of evil-looking servants with heads<br/>
Like birds, wild and domesticated animals, and ferocious beasts.<br/>
Many of the servants held sharp weapons in their hands,<br/>
With which to slice apart and devour the flesh of their victims.<br/>
Time and again they cut, and time and again flesh grew back.<br/>
Victims did not expire until their karma was fully exhausted,<br/>
And habitual tendencies did not diminish, but only increased.<br/>
For those who had performed âred offeringsâ it was even worse.<br/>
Loudly, they all screamed in terrible pain and agony.<br/>
When I had seen this external manifestation of my own perception,<br/>
I wondered what might be done to stop such suffering. </p>
<p>And, in that very instant, in the sky before me,<br/>
The Great Compassionate One appeared, and said: </p>
<p>â<em>Ema</em>! My son, who has been close to me throughout many lives,<br/>
Listen well now, you who are diligent and determined!<br/>
You have gained stability in the generation stage of deity yoga,<br/>
And have even developed a few qualities,<br/>
But the root of Dharma lies in loving kindness and compassion.<br/>
Do you have real love and compassion within yourself?<br/>
How could anyone trained in compassion ever eat flesh?<br/>
Just look at how eating meat brings such suffering!<br/>
The results of our own actions will ripen on us alone;<br/>
There is nothing the buddhas of the three times may do.<br/>
Eating meat has no virtue whatsoever but entails many faults.<br/>
It is the source of 400 forms of disease and 80,000 obstructing forces,<br/>
And it naturally brings about the 84,000 afflictive emotions.<br/>
Other than as part of the fearless conduct of benefitting all one encounters,<br/>
Or as a medicine or sacred substance of the supreme Secret Mantra,<br/>
Consumption of flesh involves not the tiniest trace of virtue.<br/>
Eating flesh is a sign of being either a <em>mÄra</em> or <em>rÄká¹£asa</em> demon.<br/>
It causes discipline to degenerate and negative emotions to increase.<br/>
Without the cause, which is altruistic love and compassion,<br/>
You will find it hard to gain the fruit, the essence of awakening.<br/>
Meat eaters are not accompanied by the wisdom deities.<br/>
They lack blessings, accomplishment, auspiciousness and activity.<br/>
The substance of altruism does not develop in eaters of flesh,<br/>
Whom gods, nÄgas and others regard as demons.<br/>
Meat eaters are plagued by <em>gandharvas, rÄká¹£asas</em>, <em>mÄras</em>,<br/>
<em>Yamas</em>, ghosts, spirits, <em>gyalpo, gongpo,</em> and samaya-breaking demons.<br/>
The result of eating meat is rebirth in the hells,<br/>
Or as a bird, a jackal, a cannibal demon, or the like.<br/>
Meat eating thus brings suffering beyond measure.<br/>
But by renouncing it, you are freed from all these faults,<br/>
And will always be revered by non-human beings,<br/>
Who will see you as a pure, authentic brahmin or god.<br/>
All the buddhas and bodhisattvas, together with their retinues, throughout the ten directions,<br/>
Gurus, <em>yidam</em> deities and á¸ÄkinÄ«s will gather around you like clouds,<br/>
And you will be accompanied by male and female bodhisattvas.<br/>
Quite naturally, you will possess the cause of loving kindness and compassion,<br/>
And swiftly reach the fruit, which is the essence of awakening.<br/>
These are just some of the inconceivable virtues to be gained.â</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and then, once my own perception had returned,<br/>
I felt as if I had awakened from a lucid dream.<br/>
My body and mind were tormented as if I had swallowed poison,<br/>
And I shook with fear and panic.<br/>
Just thinking of the terrible sufferings of the Reviving Hell,<br/>
I wished only to exchange my happiness for othersâ pain.<br/>
So utterly overwhelmed was my mind, I wept profusely.<br/>
And I felt intense, unbearable compassion.<br/>
Then, to take upon myself the sufferings of others,<br/>
And to purify their faults and obscurations caused by eating meat,<br/>
For every mother sentient being, as infinite in number as space is vast,<br/>
I made the following vow, true according to the two levels of reality:</p>
<p>â<em>Aho</em>! Mighty sage ÅÄkyamuni and all buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the whole of space and time,<br/>
Have compassion for this child who knew nothing of cause and effect!<br/>
Hosts of gracious root and lineage masters, care for me!<br/>
Have compassion for this child who knew nothing of cause and effect!<br/>
Supreme <em>yidam</em> deity, mighty AvalokiteÅvara, care for me!<br/>
Have compassion for this child who knew nothing of cause and effect! </p>
<p>Overwhelmed by ignorance and the two obscurations,<br/>
I have often spoken of how all infinite beings have been our parents,<br/>
And while living off their flesh, lectured about cause and effect.<br/>
I had no idea that the suffering involved was so great!<br/>
Often have I heard it said that eating meat with threefold purity<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a><br/>
Is sanctioned by the Buddha and does not count as sin.<br/>
But this applies only to saints who benefit all they encounter,<br/>
Like pure lotus flowers, unstained by negative emotions,<br/>
And to practitioners of the profound path of Secret Mantra.<br/>
For my part, I have no instruction more profound<br/>
Than altruistic love and compassion,<br/>
And the infallibility of cause and effect.<br/>
To purify all the faults and obscurations of eating flesh<br/>
Among all sentient beings, who extend throughout the whole of space,<br/>
From this moment on, I completely renounce the eating of flesh.<br/>
This is my unfailing commitment, which I shall never forsake.<br/>
Even if all the animals upon this earth were to be devoured,<br/>
There would still be no satisfaction; hunger would only continue to increase.<br/>
Deprived of food or drink for just a few days,<br/>
We feel as if we have never tasted even so much as a single morsel or drop before.<br/>
Now is the time to escape this demon, hunger.<br/>
What, after all, is the cause of this flesh?<br/>
It springs only from self-clinging and attachment.<br/>
Merely to think of it makes me weary, nauseated.<br/>
This utterly unappetizing mound of mess and filth,<br/>
Bound up with the thirty-six impure substances,<br/>
A body of habitual patterns and aggregates, is the basis for all suffering.<br/>
Each animal has its own negative actions,<br/>
And whoever eats the flesh of such beings will find it hard to win liberation.<br/>
Meat and alcohol are impure substances,<br/>
And to offer them does not count as generosity, the Buddha said.<br/>
Who, therefore, would eat this food of the afflictions?<br/>
<em>Pretas</em> must live for many thousands of human years<br/>
Without seeing food or drink, enduring only suffering.<br/>
But we human beings gladly drink even ice-cold water,<br/>
And have plenty to sustain us besides meat and alcohol.<br/>
If we are still not satisfied by such delights,<br/>
How could we repay past kindnesses so unfairly?<br/>
Throughout the course of countless aeons past<br/>
In every world within this universe so vast,<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a><br/>
Thereâs not a single being who has not been our mother.<br/>
And the milk we drank from maternal breasts would fill a billion seas.<br/>
I abandon all pretence; let the Three Jewels be my witness!<br/>
In the past, under the sway of ignorance and habit,<br/>
I ate my parentsâ flesh and did not remorsefully confess.<br/>
Now with pure motivation and the four powers complete,<br/>
As in the saying, âI was not, am not, and will not be attached,â<br/>
Henceforth, may the thought of eating meat never even cross my mind.<br/>
Should I ever fail, let the Three Jewels send their punishment.<br/>
May the protectors and guardians constantly keep watch.<br/>
Were I now to eat the flesh of my past mothers,<br/>
There would be no greater transgressor in all the three realms!<br/>
The Buddha said that harming others even slightly impairs one's vows.<br/>
So what need is there to mention flesh eating which involves taking life?<br/>
In the <em>ParinirvÄá¹a SÅ«tra</em>, <em>Laá¹kÄvatÄra</em> and elsewhere, it is said<br/>
That eating meat is tantamount to killing.<br/>
It is forbidden in both the greater and lesser vehicles,<br/>
But is particularly unacceptable for bodhisattvas.<br/>
Our Teacher himself, when he appeared as a partridgeâs young,<br/>
And as a ferocious beast<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>Â in the wild, would not eat meat.<br/>
How then could we, his followers, ever do so?<br/>
In accordance with the guidance of the Victorious One,<br/>
There were many great masters in India and Tibet who gave up meat.<br/>
As all this shows, the faults of meat eating are unimaginably vast.<br/>
Not cultivating negativity is itself genuine Dharma.<br/>
So may I always comply with the authentic teaching!&quot; </p>
<p>Having seen the boundless faults that come from eating meat,<br/>
Even the thought of it is as nauseating as poison.<br/>
And so, I, the great beggar with the name of DÃ¼ndÃ¼l,<br/>
Composed these words of advice to encourage my own renunciation<br/>
In the Sky Fortress hermitage of White Rock.<br/>
As a result of this virtue, may all sentient beings<br/>
Purify all the faults and obscurations that come from eating meat,<br/>
So that they may see the thousand buddhas face to face!</p>
